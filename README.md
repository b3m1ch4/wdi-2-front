## Introduction
For my second Web Development Immersive project, I chose to create an application
that could be developed into a tool that musicians use to communicate their
availability for gigs.

## List technologies used on the frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Handlebars

## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
-Load form fields that a user wants to edit
-More interactive design
-Improve the application's handlebar protections against code injection

## Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
The prompt for this project was pretty opened ended in comparison to our first
project, which was to make a very specific game. In order to focus the design of
this project, I chose to recreate a web application that I already use on a regular
basis, the gig-o-matic. The gig-o is a tool that my band uses to communicate our
availability to take a gig and I am familiar with its functions.

In order to create "bandmate," I had to distill the gig-o down to its basic form:
it is an application that has users and gigs. There are a number of other things
that the gig-o does, which I'd like to add to this application down the line, but
at its core it is those two resources.

The biggest problems that I faced in this project were learning how to effectively
identify the source of the error message (or the lack of an error message) and
communicate these issues with my instructors and classmates. It is one thing to be
able to intuit what is likely wrong with my own code, but it is another to communicate
that intuition to another in an effort to troubleshoot what the problem is.

## User stories
As a user, I expect to be able to
- signup, signin, change my password and signout
- create a gig
- view all gigs
- view a single gig
- edit a gig
- delete a gig
